      <h2>🕵️‍♂️ Spot the Vulnerability – Answers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1️⃣</strong> Aarav logs into his bank account from a café’s free public Wi-Fi without using a VPN. <br>
        👉 <span class="vuln">Vulnerability:</span> Unsafe use of public Wi-Fi <br>
        💡 Public Wi-Fi can be intercepted by hackers. Always use a VPN for sensitive logins.</li>

        <li><strong>2️⃣</strong> Sneha writes all her passwords in a notebook she keeps in her backpack. <br>
        👉 <span class="vuln">Vulnerability:</span> Insecure password storage <br>
        💡 If the notebook is lost or stolen, all her accounts are at risk. Use a password manager instead.</li>

        <li><strong>3️⃣</strong> Raj clicks on a pop-up that says “Your computer is infected! Download this free antivirus now.” <br>
        👉 <span class="vuln">Vulnerability:</span> Falling for fake pop-ups / scareware <br>
        💡 Many pop-ups are traps to install malware. Only download security software from official sources.</li>

        <li><strong>4️⃣</strong> Meera ignores her phone’s regular software update notifications to save data. <br>
        👉 <span class="vuln">Vulnerability:</span> Not updating software <br>
        💡 Updates patch security holes. Skipping them leaves devices exposed to cyberattacks.</li>

        <li><strong>5️⃣</strong> Kabir uses the same password for his email, social media, and shopping accounts. <br>
        👉 <span class="vuln">Vulnerability:</span> Password reuse <br>
        💡 If one account is hacked, attackers can access all other accounts. Always use unique passwords.</li>

        <li><strong>6️⃣</strong> Priya downloads a “cracked” version of a popular design software from an unknown website. <br>
        👉 <span class="vuln">Vulnerability:</span> Using pirated/untrusted software <br>
        💡 Cracked software often contains hidden malware. Always use licensed and trusted sources.</li>

        <li><strong>7️⃣</strong> Dev leaves his laptop unlocked on his desk when going out for lunch. <br>
        👉 <span class="vuln">Vulnerability:</span> Leaving devices unattended and unlocked <br>

    <!-- Phish or Legit Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🎣✅ Phish or Legit? – Answers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1️⃣</strong> “Dear User, your account will be closed in 24 hours. Click this link to verify your details immediately.” <br>
        👉 <span class="phish">Phish 🎣</span> – Uses urgency and vague greeting (“Dear User”) to trick people into clicking malicious links.</li>

        <li><strong>2️⃣</strong> “Amazon: Your order #548321 has been shipped. Track it here in your Amazon app.” <br>
        👉 <span class="legit">Legit ✅</span> – Real order notifications usually come through the official app or website. (Safe only if from Amazon directly.)</li>

        <li><strong>3️⃣</strong> “Congratulations! You’ve been selected for a government grant. Provide your bank details to claim.” <br>
        👉 <span class="phish">Phish 🎣</span> – Government bodies never ask for bank details over email/SMS to give grants. Classic scam.</li>

        <li><strong>4️⃣</strong> “Your friend sent you a Google Drive link to photos from yesterday’s event.” <br>
        👉 <span class="legit">Legit ✅</span> (if confirmed) – Likely safe if expected and from a known contact. Always verify before clicking.</li>

        <li><strong>5️⃣</strong> “PayPal: We noticed unusual activity. Please confirm your identity by logging in at pay-pal.verify.com.” <br>
        👉 <span class="phish">Phish 🎣</span> – The fake domain “pay-pal.verify.com” is a giveaway. Real PayPal uses only paypal.com.</li>
